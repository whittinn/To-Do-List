# To-Do-List
Project for Sibel Health

This IOS application is called To-Do-List and was created using Swift. I implemented Core Data to persist data create by the user. The user has the ability to save, update, delete, and edit each note stored into the appliction using Core Data. With more time I could have implemented Firebase to help with authentication, along with Facebook Sign in to extend the application's audiences. I also would have encorpated some animation for the login view.
